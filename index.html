<p>6x9 Time is a decimal time system inspired by Swatch Internet Time, but in a traditional format (i.e. hours, minutes, and seconds).</p>

<p>It should be noted that, although the idea may not be new, the script is all my own work.</p>

<p>It is based on UTC and, like its inspiration, has no timezones.</p>

<p>Until I can think of better names, the units are "hours", "minutes", and "seconds" and there are:</p>

<ul>
<li>100 "seconds" in a "minute"</li>
<li>100 "minutes" in an "hour"</li>
<li>20 "hours" in a day (days are the same length as normal, just divided into 20 rather than 24).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, when it's 12pm normally, it's 10pm in 6x9 Time</p>

<p>By default the script uses a 20-hour clock, but it can be converted to 10-hour with minimal tweaking of the code (There should be comments by every relevent line).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although the clock uses JavaScript to display and update the time, the maths is performed by PHP. Your server will require PHP to use the clock.</p>

<a id="the-maths" class="anchor" href="#the-maths" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Maths</h2>

<p>Since the days are the same length, the current 6x9 Time is calculated using the number of real seconds since midnight at the start of the current day.</p>

<p>Knowing the number of each type of second in a day, seconds can be easily converted into "seconds" (1 second is 2.3148148148148 "seconds").</p>

<p>Having today's total number of elapsed "seconds", the "hours" and "minutes" can be calculated.</p>

<p>The 3 numbers are then passed to a modified version of the Timezone Cheat Clock.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are exactly 432 milliseconds in a "second", which makes looping the JavaScript very easy; the 1000 millisecond dealy is replaced with a 432 millisecond delay without having to worry about fractions.</p>

<a id="using" class="anchor" href="#using" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using</h2>

<p>Add</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="6x9time.php" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to the &lt;head&gt; section of the page, remembering to change the path to the script as appropriate.</p>

<p>Then add</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span id="SxNtime"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where you want the clock to appear.</p>

<p>You don't have to use a &lt;span&gt;; you can use anything, as long as you give it a unique ID and add that ID to the list in the script. The script comes preset to recognise the following 6 IDs: SxNtime, SxNtime1, SxNtime2, SxNtime3, SxNtime4, and SxNtime5.</p>
