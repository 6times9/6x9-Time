Your server will require PHP to use the clock.\r\n\r\n##The Maths\r\n\r\nSince the days are the same length, the current 6x9 Time is calculated using the number of real seconds since midnight at the start of the current day.\r\n\r\nKnowing the number of each type of second in a day, seconds can be easily converted into \"seconds\" (1 second is 2.3148148148148 \"seconds\").\r\n\r\nHaving today's total number of elapsed \"seconds\", the \"hours\" and \"minutes\" can be calculated.\r\n\r\nThe 3 numbers are then passed to a modified version of the Timezone Cheat Clock.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are exactly 432 milliseconds in a \"second\", which makes looping the JavaScript very easy; the 1000 millisecond dealy is replaced with a 432 millisecond delay without having to worry about fractions.\r\n\r\n##Using\r\n\r\nAdd\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"6x9time.php\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n\r\nto the &lt;head&gt; section of the page, remembering to change the path to the script as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThen add\r\n\r\n    <span id=\"SxNtime\"></span>\r\n\r\nwhere you want the clock to appear.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to use a &lt;span&gt;; you can use anything, as long as you give it a unique ID and add that ID to the list in the script. The script comes preset to recognise the following 6 IDs: SxNtime, SxNtime1, SxNtime2, SxNtime3, SxNtime4, and SxNtime5.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
